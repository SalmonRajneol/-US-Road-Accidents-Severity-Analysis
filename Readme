🚗 US Road Accidents Severity Analysis
📌 Project Overview
🧠 Inspiration & Context
“Advancing Decision-Making in Computer Information Systems through Sophisticated Data Visualization” (2022) outlines how advanced visualization methods empower better decision-making by making large and complex datasets more interpretable. This project aligns with that philosophy by applying real-world geospatial and severity-based visualization to uncover insights in U.S. road accident data.
This project analyzes the spatial distribution and severity (fatal vs. non-fatal) of road accidents across the United States, focusing on trends before and after a key date (e.g., a policy change or event). The goal is to extract actionable insights from geolocation data to support safety and infrastructure decisions.

📊 Key Highlights
Severity Mapping
Visualized accident severity using scatter plots across longitude and latitude. Red triangles indicate fatal accidents, while gray triangles denote non-fatal ones.

Temporal Impact
Split the data to analyze patterns before and after a certain date, observing shifts in the geographical and severity distribution of accidents.

Visual Storytelling
Used distinct markers and colors to clearly communicate severity differences. Integrated a high-contrast design to highlight clusters and trends effectively.

Geospatial Analysis
Plotted data on a US map grid to detect accident hotspots and spatial trends.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, NumPy for data processing

Matplotlib / Seaborn: for custom visualizations

PowerPoint / Illustrator: for final presentation design

Jupyter Notebook: for step-by-step analysis and explanation

📈 Outcomes
Identified high-risk zones and severity-based accident patterns.

Produced clean, publication-quality visuals suitable for stakeholders.

Demonstrated skills in data visualization, geospatial analysis, and communication of insights.
