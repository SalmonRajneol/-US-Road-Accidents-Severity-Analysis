🚗 US Road Accidents Severity Analysis
Visualizing Data to Drive Safer Roads
“The ability to visualize large, complex datasets is central to modern decision-making in computer information systems.”
— Inspired by the research article Advancing Decision-Making through Sophisticated Data Visualization (2022)

🧩 Project Objective
This project explores the severity and geospatial distribution of road accidents in the United States, with a focus on identifying trends before and after a significant date (e.g., a policy shift or pandemic milestone).

🔍 Key Insights
Created a scatter map of accident locations using longitude and latitude.

Differentiated between fatal (red) and non-fatal (gray) accidents using marker shapes.

Detected regional clusters and potential hotspots of fatal accidents.

Visualized change in accident patterns over time using layered plots.

📊 Techniques & Tools Used
Category	Tools/Methods
Language	Python
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Wrangling	Pandas, NumPy
Presentation	PowerPoint, Adobe Illustrator (Design Slides)
Conceptual Base	KDE, Box Plots, Correlation Maps (as studied in article)
🧠 Theory in Practice
This project integrates concepts from the article:

KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) to identify hotspots (potential extension).

Categorical Visualization to differentiate accident severity.

Visual Storytelling using strong contrast, symbols, and annotations.

Performance Metrics to track accident types across time frames.
